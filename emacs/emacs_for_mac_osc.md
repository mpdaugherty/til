[Emacs for Mac OSX](http://emacsformacosx.com/)

Use this if you want a clean Emacs install on OSX. It's just GNU Emacs built for OSX.

Aquamacs:

 * + feels more native on OSX
 * - it's a separate code base
 * - lags behind Emacs slightly
 * - some plugins don't work on Aquamacs as well


## Notes 2016-03-12

I've used Aquamacs for the last 4-5 years. I'm setting up a new computer from scratch, however, so I've decided to try starting with cleaner Emacs configuration.
