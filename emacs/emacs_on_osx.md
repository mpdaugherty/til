## Emacs for Mac OSX

[Emacs for Mac OSX](http://emacsformacosx.com/)

Use this if you want a clean Emacs install on OSX. It's just GNU Emacs built for OSX. I'm using this right now.

 * + GNU Emacs
 * + Stays up to date
 * - Doesn't feel as smooth on OSX, e.g. scrolls line-by-line instead of per-pixel

## Aquamacs:

 * + feels more native on OSX
 * - it's a separate code base
 * - lags behind Emacs slightly
 * - some plugins don't work on Aquamacs as well


## Notes 2016-03-12

I've used Aquamacs for the last 4-5 years. I'm setting up a new computer from scratch, however, so I've decided to try starting with a clean Emacs configuration, so I'm installing Emacs for Mac OSX.
